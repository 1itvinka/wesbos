Hey there - in an effort to promote a few of my projects, I got a whole bunch of stickers made! I've been handing them out like candy locally, but many have asked if I could mail you a few.

For $2, you will get a 5 sticker pack - that will help cover the cost of shipping and the PayPal Fees. Will ship anywhere in the world.

The stickers are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://commandlinepoweruser.com"><strong>Command Line Power User</strong></a> — my free video series on ZSH, Z + related tooling.</li>
<li><a href="https://sublimetextbook.com/"><strong>Sublime Text Power User</strong></a> Badge - my book + video series on mastering Sublime Text</li>
<li><strong> Good At Gulp</strong> - an upcoming book + video series I'm working on</li>
<li><strong>Gulp Logo</strong> - only 100 of these left!</li>
<li><strong>What The FlexBox</strong> - an upcoming video series on FlexBox</li>
</ul>

Interested? I have enough stickers for about 150 packs. Fill out the form below and I'll throw them in the mail for you. By signing up, I'll send you an email when I launch new video or book tutorials.

<strong>Sorry Folks - I've given them all away. Make sure to follow me on twitter or like my FB page - I'll give away some more once I've got them printed! </strong>
