There's one last thing we need to know about destructuring objects, and that is the ability to set defaults. This one's a little bit confusing, so bear with me here and we're going to circle back for another example later on in a couple of videos over at <a href="https://ES6.io">ES6.io</a>.

When you destructure an object, what happens if that value isn't there?


```js
const settings = {
    speed: 150
}
const { speed, width } = settings; 
console.log(width);
```

What is width? It's <code>undefined</code> because we create the variable, but it's not able to be set to anything.

With destructuring we can set defaults, or <em>fallback values</em> so that if an item is not in the object (or Array, Map, or Set) it will fall back to what you have set at the default.

This syntax is a little hard to read:


```js
const settings = {
    speed: 150
}
const { speed = 750, width = 500 } = settings;
console.log(speed); // 150 - comes from settings object
console.log(width); // 500 - fallback to default
```

Now if the <code>speed</code> or <code>width</code> properties don't exist on our <code>settings</code> object, they fallback to <code>750</code> and <code>500</code> respectively.

<h2>Careful: null and undefined</h2>

One thing to note here is that this isn't 100% the same as this old trick used to fallback when <code>settings.speed</code> is not set:


```js
const mySpeed = 0;
const speed = mySpeed || 760; 
console.log(speed); // 760!
```

Why? Because ES6 destructuring default values only kick in if the value is undefined. null, false and 0 are all still values!


```js
const { dogName = 'snickers' } = { dogName: undefined }
console.log(dogName) // what will it be? 'snickers'!

const { dogName = 'snickers' } = { dogName: null }
console.log(dogName) // what will it be? null!

const { dogName = 'snickers' } = { dogName: false }
console.log(dogName) // what will it be? false!

const { dogName = 'snickers' } = { dogName: 0 }
console.log(dogName) // what will it be? 0!
```

<h3>Combining with Destructuring Renaming</h3>

In my last post we learned that we can destrucutre and rename varaibles at the same time with something like this:


```js
const person = {
  first: 'Wes',
  last: 'Bos',
};

const { first: firstName } = person;
console.log(firstName); // Wes
```

We can also set defaults in the same go. Hold onto your head because this syntax is going to get funky!


```js
const person = { first: 'Wes', last: 'Bos' };
const { middle: middleName = 'Super Rad' } = person;
console.log(middleName); // 'Super Rad'
```

Woah - let's step through that one!

<ol>
<li>First we create a new const var called <code>middleName</code>.</li>
<li>Next we look for <code>person.middle</code>. If there was a <code>person.middle</code> property, it would be put into the <code>middleName</code> variable.</li>
<li>There isn't a <code>middle</code> property on our <code>person</code> object, so we fall back to the default of <code>Super Rad</code>. </li>
</ol>
