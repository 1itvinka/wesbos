The other problem using <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> will fix is with our <code>for</code> loop.

This is something that you probably have all run into with your regular <code>for</code> loop, like one that will count from zero to nine:


```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

```

Problems that arise here are two things:

<strong>First</strong> of all, if I type <code>i</code> into the console, it returns <code>10</code>. We have this global variable that has leaked into the window, or into a parent scope, which is not something we necessarily want. It's just a placeholder value that we need to work inside of this loop.

<strong>Second</strong> of all, maybe you had something that's going to run after some bit of time, an AJAX request, or, for this case, I going to mark it up with a <code>setTimeout()</code> and that function is going to run after one second:


```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('The number is ' + i);
  },1000);
}

```

If we run this, all of them are 10. The reason that we have that is because, <code>console.log(i)</code>  will run immediately and reference whatever <code>i</code> is. That runs immediately at <code>console.log</code> itself.

However, after one second, this entire loop has already gone through every iteration that it needs to and the variable <code>i</code> here is being overwritten every single time.

The problem with that is that by the time the first <code>setTimeout()</code> runs, <code>i</code> is already at 10, and we don't have any way to reference it.

If you had an AJAX request where you are looping through a few of them, there isn't any way without an IFFE to reference what the <code>i</code> variable was when it ran, not what it currently is after the loop.

One quick way we can fix that is if we just change <code>var</code> to <code>let</code>:


```js
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 console.log(i);
 setTimeout(function() {
   console.log('The number is ' + i);
 },1000);
}

```

What do we know about <code>let</code>? It's block-scoped. We have curly brackets in the <code>for</code> loop. If you run it now, after a second we'll log zero through nine. We're not getting 10, 10 times. We getting it as it was declared each and every time.

As a note, you couldn't use a <code>const</code> for this because it needs to overwrite itself, and you can't assign the same variable twice. When we use <code>let</code>, it's going to scope <code>i</code> to our curly brackets.
