Many people, myself included, were annoyed that you aren't able to put the new Newsstand Icon in a folder. Well a quick little <a href="http://thecodingmassacre.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/newsstand-folder-no-jailbreak-ios-5/" target="_blank">hack</a> I found today lets you do just that! Turns out you can trick iOS5 by creating a folder with other icons and then quickly drag it into that folder.

This doesn't require you to jail break, but it does take a quick finger! Watch this video to see how to do it:

<h3>Note</h3>
This should only be done if you are no using newsstand. Trying to launch newsstand from within a folder crashes springboard!</h3>
