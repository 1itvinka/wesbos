It's here! I'm incredible proud to announce Beginner JavaScript â€” a fun, exercise heavy approach to learning Modern JavaScript from scratch. This is a course I've worked on for over a year, and I've been dreaming of how to make the best introduction to JavaScript for years now. 
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
A rock solid understanding of JavaScript is essential for success, no matter which framework you use. <strong>This course will give you that.</strong>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
JavaScript is hard to learn. Frustration, abandonment and
 rage quits all stem from trying to use something when we don't 
understand how things work.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Being able to make your ideas is a super power. Invest in a solid base and you'll slam dunk anything that comes your way.
