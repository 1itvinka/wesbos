In <a href="http://flexbox.io">What The Flexbox</a>, one of the biggest questions I've received is <strong>"how do you get your colours to show up in Sublime Text like that"</strong>?

I've answered it maybe 20 times now. The trick is getting them to show up all the time, instead of just when you click a color. This is one of my favourite packages because it works in CSS, Stylus, Sass and Less! Here is a quick 101. Watch the video or read the text below:

<strong>First</strong>, install the <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Color%20Highlighter">Color Highlighter package</a> from Package Control

<strong>Next</strong>, restart Sublime Text.

<strong>Then</strong>, in Preferences → Package Settings → Color Highlighter → Settings - User

Use the "filled" setting to make them show all the time.


```js
{
"ha_style": "filled"
}

```
