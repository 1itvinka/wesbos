**Update:** The teespring is now over! Thanks to everyone who purchased a shirt, hoodie or tank. All 10 winners have been picked and emailed about shirt arrangements. Enjoy!

I love JavaScript and I love shirts! Do you? If you do, then you should get a <a href="http://teespring.com/javascript-shirts">JavaScript Shirt, Tank or Hoodie</a> in blue or black on TeeSpring. I've set the campaign to $12 per shirt, which means that there is <em>no profit being made here</em> - it's just an effort to get JS devs some really great shirts!

Available in high quality American Apparel, these shirts are screen printed and are the top quality — no iron ons here. I've ordered from Teespring many times and I've always been very happy with the product. <del datetime="2015-07-20T14:09:27+00:00">The campaign needs to sell</del> We have already sold the 15 needed, so <a href="http://teespring.com/javascript-shirts">grab yours today</a> and you for sure get it!

<h3><a href="http://wesbos.com/giveaways/javascript-shirt-giveaway/">Tshirt Giveaway!</a></h3>

In an effort to get the word out - I'll be giving away 10 shirts! Simply <a href="http://wesbos.com/giveaways/javascript-shirt-giveaway/">Enter Here →</a> and you'll be notified if you have won a shirt. You may pick any shirt available and it will be mailed anywhere in the world. Good luck!

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<h4>Did you make the JS Logo?</h4>

No, but it's a <a href="https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js">community project</a> licensed under MIT so you are welcome to print it on your own stuff as well!

<h4>What if I buy a shirt, and then win?</h4>

If you win and have already bought one, I'll make sure you get a refund so you don't have to pay for one!

<h4>Can I get one in ${color} || ${garmentType} || ${design}</h4>

I've made a handful of different options available that should suit most tastes - if you aren't fond of the design or shirt types, I'd love to hear what you would like best, but this time around it's all I'm offering

<h4>Why are they so cheap?</h4>

I'm not looking to make any money off selling these shirts. I know developers love t-shirts and stickers, and after a <a href="http://wesbos.com/dev-stickers/">successful sticker giveaway</a>, I thought I'd try my hand at doing a few shirts as well!

<h4>I have a question about Sizing, Shipping, Prices</h4>

Please contact TeeSpring directly for those questions.
