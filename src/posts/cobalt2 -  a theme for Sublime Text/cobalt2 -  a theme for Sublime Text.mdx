Update: November 2014 - these theme has received a major UI upgrade for new Sublime Features and editor tweaks.

I love text editor colour schemes. I've tried dozens of them over the years but always found myself coming back to trusty old cobalt. I liked this theme quite a but but I didn't <em>love</em> it. So, over the years I've tweaked and tuned cobalt into a theme that I am very happy with. Its easy on the eyes, works well across many languages and takes note of those little UI elements like the caret, searches and bracket matching.

I have had quite a few friends use my theme and they seem to be sticking with it. So, I've decided to release it to the masses. To download it, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2" target="_blank">github repo.</a> As always, would love to hear any feedback you may have :)

Quick aside: I wrote a <a href="https://sublimetextbook.com" title="Sublime Text Book">book on sublime text</a> which comes along with a video series. If you like my themes and blog posts on Sublime Text, you will love this!

#cobalt2
A Sublime Text theme based on our old blue friend cobalt.

A refined colour scheme that is easy on the eyes and takes small UI elements into account. Includes full sublime theme (sidebar, search, tabs, etc...) as well as support for SublimeLinter, git diffing and a growing number of plugins.

See below for examples. <a href="http://wesbos.com/cobalt2-theme-sublime-text-2/">Read more at http://wesbos.com/cobalt2-theme-sublime-text-2/</a>
